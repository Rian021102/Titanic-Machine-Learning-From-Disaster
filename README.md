# Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster
This is the final project from Hacktiv8. The case is Titanic-Machine Learning From Disaster from Kaggle competition 
The goak of this project is to predict that the likelihood of each passenger who possesses uniqe features (such as ticket class, age, sex, number of family, embarkment port) survival. 
The dataset is devided into two datasets. train.csv and test.csv. train.csv will be the dataset used for training the machine learning model and test.csv will be used for prediction using model that has been trained.
